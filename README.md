- Creating ROS workspace and adding Parrot arsdk




## Installing Ubuntu 20.04

This guide will walk you through the steps to install Ubuntu 20.04 on your system.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A USB flash drive with at least 4GB of storage.
- A computer or laptop where you want to install Ubuntu.

## Step 1: Download Ubuntu 20.04 ISO

1. Go to the [Ubuntu 20.04 download page](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/).
2. Choose the version (e.g., Desktop) and click on the download link to download the ISO file.

## Step 2: Create a Bootable USB Drive

1. Insert the USB flash drive into your computer.
2. Download and install a tool like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) (for Windows) or [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) (for macOS and Linux) to create a bootable USB drive.
3. Open the tool and select the Ubuntu ISO file you downloaded.
4. Choose the USB drive as the target.
5. Start the process and wait until it's complete.

## Step 3: Boot from USB and Install Ubuntu

1. Restart your computer and boot from the USB drive. This usually involves pressing a key (e.g., F2, F12, or Del) during startup to access the boot menu.
2. Select the USB drive as the boot device.
3. Once the Ubuntu installer loads, select "Install Ubuntu" from the options.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions, choosing your language, keyboard layout, and installation type.
5. If you're new to Ubuntu, you can select the option to install third-party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware, as well as updates during installation.
6. Choose the installation type (e.g., "Erase disk and install Ubuntu" for a clean installation or "Something else" for manual partitioning).
7. Create a user account and password.
8. Wait for the installation to complete.
9. Once the installation is finished, click "Restart Now" to boot into your new Ubuntu 20.04 system.

## Step 4: Post-Installation Steps

1. Update your system: Open the terminal and run the following commands:
2. 2. Install additional software as needed.
3. Enjoy your new Ubuntu 20.04 system!

One thing you should take into consideration is Parrot arsdk works properly only on Ubuntu 20.04

## Installing Ros noetic


This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing ROS Noetic on a supported Ubuntu system. ROS (Robot Operating System) is an open-source middleware framework for robotics.


**Note:** ROS Noetic is officially supported on Ubuntu 20.04, but this guide may also work for later versions of Ubuntu.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 20.04 (other versions of Ubuntu may work, but this guide is specifically for 20.04)
- A terminal or command-line interface

## Step 1: Set up the sources.list and set up the ROS Noetic repository

1. Configure your Ubuntu repositories to allow "restricted," "universe," and "multiverse."

sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo add-apt-repository multiverse
sudo apt-get update

2. Add the ROS Noetic repository.

sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

3. Set up your keys.

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver 'hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654

## Step 2: Installation

1. First, make sure your packages are up to date.


2. Install ROS Noetic Desktop-Full, which includes the ROS, rqt, rviz, and robot-generic libraries.

3. Initialize rosdep.

Sure, here's a template for a GitHub README on installing ROS Noetic (as of my last knowledge update in September 2021). Be sure to check the official ROS website for the latest installation instructions.
